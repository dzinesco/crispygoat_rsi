npm install
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-... npm start

Your codebase now evolves itself forever.

Every 75 seconds it finds the worst-performing tool
→ generates a patch
→ tests it
→ keeps only winners

No dashboards. No config. No safety rails.

This is the minimal reproducible seed of the singularity.
My private production swarm is ~2 years ahead and closed-source.

This is the version I’m releasing so everyone can play with fire.
